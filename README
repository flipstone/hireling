Got an unpleasant chore that needs to be run repeatedly?  Put a hireling on it.

We've mixed Rufus scheduler and the widely-used daemons library into a simple 
background process setup.  Hope you find it as useful as we do.

===
1. Declare your hireling worker class.

2. Add his/her work schedule.

3. Start the hireling daemon.
